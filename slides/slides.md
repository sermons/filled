# Q0

******
[15](# "ref")
When one of those who reclined at table <br>
with him heard these things, he said to him,

“Blessed is everyone who will <br>
eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

******

[16](# "ref")
But he said to him,<br>
“A man once gave a great banquet and invited many.

[17](# "ref")
And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant<br>
to say to those who had been invited,<br>
‘Come, for everything is now ready.’

[18](# "ref")
But they all alike began to make excuses.

******

The first said to him,<br>
‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it.<br>
Please have me excused.’

[19](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen,<br>
and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.’

[20](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have married a wife,<br>
and therefore I cannot come.’

******

[21](# "ref")
So the servant came<br>
and reported these things to his master.

Then the master of the house became angry<br>
and said to his servant,<br>
‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city,<br>
and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’

******

[22](# "ref")
And the servant said,<br>
‘Sir, what you commanded has been done,<br>
and still there is room.’

[23](# "ref")
And the master said to the servant,<br>
‘Go out to the highways and hedges<br>
and compel people to come in,<br>
that my house may be filled.

******

[24](# "ref")
For I tell you, none of those men<br>
who were invited shall taste my banquet.’”

cf Mt22:1-14

review: feast at home of Pharisee leader:
+ (man w/edema) healing more important than rules
  + (beware hardening against Jesus)
+ (to guests): don't desire to be first: for even son of man did not come to be served but to serve
  + (beware exalting oneself)
+ (to host): invite those who can't repay you, that you may be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous
+ 15 how wonderful to feast in the kingdom of God!
  + impl.: how wonderful for **us**
  + assume will enter kingdom of God
+ today's parable is Jesus' reply: don't be so sure you're going to be at that feast!

16-17 (Mt22:1-4) setup/intro: desire of host/master/king: celebrate, share celebration with others. Focus is not on the merit of the guests but on the object of celebration, e.g., wedding of son. 
+ context: planned well in advance, implied that guests already RSVPd
  + very big: v22 still have space. So host very wealthy, e.g., king
  + all ready (v17, Mt22:4): bull killed, can't cancel, immediate timeline (that evening)
+ rare we have big celebrations, but wedding, baby shower, etc.
+ the invited: Jews, the churched, those who have heard Christ's call
  + and may even have said "yes" to God!

18-20 (Mt22:5-6) excuses/response of invited:
+ 18 bought field: buying property, having possessions
+ 19 bought oxen: invest in business, building career
+ 20 got married: relationships / family
+ Mt22:2 unwilling
+ Mt22:5 didn't care, back to own business
+ Mt22:6 beat, humiliated, killed servants: why must you keep reminding me?
+ "cancel culture": flexibility, spontaneity, but also lack of commitment, demonstrates where our priorities are
+ context: pharisees
  + successful, accomplished, good at what we do: in property, biz, relationships
+ what we've built for ourselves becomes important to us
  + God's continual invitation/reminder interrupts our daily life, becomes annoying

21-24 (Mt22:7-10) action of master:
+ 21 anger: Mt22:7 even more severe
+ 21 with speed, at once: urgency
+ streets+alleys of city: both big and small streets, anywhere
+ poor, crippled (injured in limbs), blind, lame (stopped, unable to walk)
+ 23 roads + hedges: countryside, farther afield: not enough guests
  + not necessarily poor, just any random person
  + compel them: might not be needy or as eager for a free meal
+ host's objective is to fill his house: celebrate, share his joy with those who would share his joy
+ again, guests' own accomplishments, prior relationship w/host, etc. are irrelevant
  + Mt22:8 those invited were not worthy:
  + receiving invitation (hearing God's word) doesn't make us worthy
  + being poor doesn't make us worthy
  + being holy doesn't make us worthy
+ it takes action: coming to the feast
  + with intent: purpose is to share in Master's joy, not just get free meal

Mt22:11-14: wedding clothes
+ clothes in Scripture: represent good deeds (e.g., Rev7:9)
  + only those with clean clothes (have done holiness) may enter
  + are the poor to buy clean, fancy wedding clothes?
+ no, it was the host who would give garments to guests, like wedding favours (cf Samson, Jdg14)
  + extravagance of clothes indicated wealth of host
+ so a guest w/o wedding clothes means he **refused** the gift!
+ only those w/holy living may enter heaven
  + God imputes holiness to us through Christ: gives us the clothes
  + but we must accept the gift
+ many are called (invited), few are chosen (selected by preference)

+ Is65:1-2 "here I am", spread out hands all day to rebellious people
+ Lk13:34 long to gather as hen, but you would not have it
+ Is30:15 repentance+rest, but you were not willing
