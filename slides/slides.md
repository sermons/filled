## [Luke](# "ref"): the **Kingdom** of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and
  + Who will *enter* it
+ [(13:22-30)](# "ref") Parable of the **narrow gate**:
  + "Lord, *open* to us"
  + "I do not *know* where you come from.<br>*Depart* from me!"

>>>
+ a continual **theme** in Luke is
  + the **kingdom** of God
+ Jesus **tells** us what it's like by
  + how He **heals** + performs miracles,
  + the **parables** He teaches, and
  + His **actions** leading to the cross
+ Here the **mid-section** of Luke is
  + marked by many **parables**

## [Luke 14](# "ref"): Teachings at a **Feast**
+ [(v1-6)](# "ref") Man ill with *edema*:
  + **Healing** more important than rules
+ [(v7-11)](# "ref") *Guests* taking seats of honour:
  + **Humble** yourself, that God may exalt

  + **Hospitality** to those who cannot repay
+ Today: [v15-24](# "ref") Who is **worthy** to enter
  + the **feast** in the kingdom of God?

>>>
+ Setting: banquet at home of prominent **Pharisee**
+ heals man of **edema**: 
  + beware **hardening** against Jesus
+ speaks to the other **guests**: 
  + beware **exalting** oneself
+ speaks to the **host**:
  + invite those who **can't** repay you
  + so that you may be **repaid**
  + at the **resurrection** of the righteous
+ at this, a fellow **guest** remarks:
  + how wonderful to **feast** in the kingdom of God!
  + impl.: how wonderful for **us**
  + **assume** will enter kingdom of God
+ today's parable is Jesus' **reply**:
  + don't be so **sure** you're going to be at that feast!

When one of those who reclined at table <br>
with him heard these things, he said to him,

“Blessed is everyone who will <br>
eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

[16](# "ref")
But he said to him, “A man once gave <br>
a great banquet and invited many.

[17](# "ref")
And at the time for the banquet <br>
he sent his servant to say <br>
to those who had been invited,

‘Come, for everything is now ready.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

******

[18](# "ref")
But they all alike began to make excuses.

The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, <br>
and I must go out and see it.<br>
Please have me excused.’

[19](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have bought <br>
five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. <br>
Please have me excused.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.3/6)](# "ref")

******

[20](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have married a wife,<br>
and therefore I cannot come.’

[21](# "ref")
So the servant came<br>
and reported these things to his master.

Then the master of the house became angry<br>
and said to his servant,

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

******

‘Go out quickly <br>
to the streets and lanes of the city,

and bring in the poor and crippled <br>
and blind and lame.’

And the servant said,<br>
‘Sir, what you commanded has been done,<br>
and still there is room.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.5/6)](# "ref")

******

[23](# "ref")
And the master said to the servant,<br>
‘Go out to the highways and hedges

and compel people to come in,<br>
that my house may be filled.

For I tell you, none of those men<br>
who were invited shall taste my banquet.’”

## Parable of the Banquet [(Lk14)](# "ref")
1. Rejoicing [(v16-17)](# "ref")
1. Rejection [(v18-20)](# "ref")
1. Redemption [(v21-24)](# "ref")

>>>
+ On first read, wonder **why** was master so **angry**?
  + guests' **excuses** seem reasonable
  + can't just **drop** everything for your party
+ But as we dive **deeper** into this passage 
  + and **parallel** parable in Mt22:1-14
+ we understand bit more of **heart** of our
  + Heavenly Father of **abundant** blessings
+ 3 **parts** of this parable
  + follows outline of **salvation**: mini-gospel

1. master's **invitation** to share in celebration
  + focus not on **guests**
  + but on master's **joy** which he wishes to share
2. **response** of those invited
  + fall/sin
  + priorities
3. master **extends** invitation to all comers
  + **fill** His house
  + all who would **accept** His gift
  + and **share** in His joy

+ First: dwell on heart of Father
  + not on our own sorrows/needs

---
A man once gave <br>
a great **banquet** and invited **many**.

[Luke 14:16 (ESV)](# "ref")

The kingdom of heaven may be compared to <br>
a **king** who gave a **wedding feast** for his son

[Matthew 22:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ plenty of **room**: huge celebration
  + king would've been very **wealthy**
+ isn't it **nice** that the **kingdom of heaven**
  + is like a wonderful **celebration**!
  + what beautiful **hope**
______
+ for us, we rarely have big **celebrations**:
  + wedding, baby shower, etc.
+ e.g., our wedding banquet had **26 tables**
  + friend's had **40**
+ agonised over **guest list**
  + esp. **out-of-town** friends+relatives
  + regret not spending **time** w/them
+ but: ultimately, focus is **not** on guests
  + who "makes the **cut**" to be on the list
+ focus is on the **reason** for our joy
  + thankful to **God** for Providence
+ and we want to **share** that joy with others

---
And at the **time** for the banquet <br>
he sent his servant to say <br>
to those who had been **invited**,<br>
"Come, for everything is now **ready**."

[Luke 14:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

"My **oxen** and my fat calves <br>
have been **slaughtered**"

[Matthew 22:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ a celebration that **big** would have been
  + **planned** well in advance: **save-the-date**
  + those invited would have already RSVPd
+ so when **time** came,
  + (Mt) oxen killed: can't **cancel**
+ king is **looking forward** to
  + **sharing** his joy w/guests
+ in the same way, the **King of kings**
  + has a **celebration** planned
  + after the final **judgment**:

---
And I saw the **holy city**, new Jerusalem,<br>
coming down out of **heaven** from God,<br>
prepared as a **bride** adorned for her husband.

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

---
[3](# "ref")
And I heard <br>
a loud voice from the throne saying,

“Behold! <br>
the **dwelling place** of God is with man.

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.2/4)](# "ref")

---
He will dwell with them, <br>
and they will be **his people**,

and God himself will be with them <br>
as **their God**.

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.3/4)](# "ref")

---
[4](# "ref")
He will wipe away every **tear** from their eyes,

and **death** shall be no more,<br>
neither shall there be **mourning**,<br>
nor **crying**, nor **pain** anymore,

for the **former** things have passed away.”

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.4/4)](# "ref")

>>>
+ this is our ultimate **hope**! 
+ Yes, we must still be **vigilant** in
  + **defending** against disease
  + but we can never **eradicate** it
+ bc **death**, pain, and sin belong to 
  + this **present** age
+ but we have a future **hope**
  + the **wedding** feast
  + culmination of God's plan of **salvation**

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# What **joy** does <br> the King wish <br> to **share** with us?

>>>
+ **hard** to think about God's **promises**
  + seem so **far** away
  + my **stress** / need / pain is right **now**
+ and that's exactly our **problem**:
+ we are focused on getting **back** to
  + our **busy** lives
+ we've forgotten to look **forward** to
  + the future **hope**
  + God has **reserved** for those who accept it
+ [prompt for pause]

## outline 2

>>>
+ first, understand the **master's** joy
  + wants to **share** with others
+ now, we turn to the **invited**:
  + Jews, the **churched**
  + those who have heard Christ's **call**
  + and even said "**yes**" to God!
  + (**RSVP**: e.g., baptized)
+ their **excuses** indicate they **prioritize**
  + their **own** endeavours over
  + the **joy** of the king

"I have **married** a wife, <br>

[Luke 14:18-20 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ field: buy property, **possessions**
  + oxen: invest in biz, build **career**
  + married: **relationships** / family
+ all good **blessings** from God
  + things that normally **fill** our lives
+ **obligations** ("must", "cannot"):
  + e.g., Chinese **work ethic** sees
  + **responsibilities** as more important
  + than **celebration**
+ COVID19: all these on **hold**
  + **crisis**: interruption causes
  + reexamine our **priorities**
+ clarify: God is not **pleased** w/COVID
  + our world + bodies are **broken**
  + because of **sin** of all mankind
+ in the **midst** of our trials
  + God sends **reminders** time + again
+ Mt: king sends servants **multiple** times
  + invited respond even more **strongly**:

---
They paid **no attention** and went off, <br>
one to his **farm**, <br>
another to his **business**, 

[6](# "ref")
while the rest **seized** his servants, <br>
treated them **shamefully**, <br>
and **killed** them.

[Matthew 22:5-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ servants represent **prophets**
  + who **spoke** Word of God
+ when God **reminds** us to
  + **adjust** our priorities,
+ we either **ignore** Him, or say:
  + "you're **interrupting** my daily life"
  + "your party isn't **that** important to me"
  + "why must you keep **pestering** me?"
+ All along, God is **offering** us
  + a **pathway** to peace
+ but we see it as **bothersome**
  + in the preceding **chapter**:

---
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, <br>
the city that **kills** the prophets <br>
and **stones** those who are sent to it!

How often would I have<br>
gathered your **children** together<br>
as a **hen** gathers her brood under her wings,

and you were **not willing**!

[Luke 13:34 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Father longs to **comfort** + protect
  + keep us **close** to Him
+ it is **we** who are unwilling
  + trust in our **independence**
+ again, in **Isaiah**:

---
For thus said the Lord God,<br>
the Holy One of Israel,

“In **returning** and **rest** you shall be saved;<br>
in **quietness** and in **trust**<br>
shall be your strength.”

But you were **unwilling**!

[Isaiah 30:15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ He offers **salvation** + strength
+ as we **return** to Him (= repent)
  + both humble **stillness**
  + and faithful **action**
+ but we **reject** it! 
+ our **lives** we've built for ourselves
  + become **essential** to us
+ God's continual **invitation** / reminders
  + **interrupt** our daily life
  + we become **annoyed**
+ like the **Pharisees**, we are
  + so proud of having the **invitation**
+ but do we actually want to **go**?

# Do I **hope** for Christ's **return**, or **cling** to my lifestyle? 

>>>
+ complete **upheaval** of way of life
+ prior to Christ's **return**, increased
  + **natural** disasters: famine, disease
  + **human** disasters: war, betrayal
+ our **hope** is not that God

## outline 3

>>>
1. Master has a **reason** to celebrate

2. Those invited just want to get on w/**regular life**

Then the master of the house became **angry**<br>
and said to his servant,

‘Go out **quickly** <br>
to the **streets** and **lanes** of the city,

and bring in the **poor** and **crippled** <br>
and **blind** and **lame**.’

[Luke 14:21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **angry**: Mt22:7 even more severe

+ **streets** + alleys of city:
  + both big and **small** streets
  + **anywhere**, at random
+ **poor**, crippled (injured in limbs),
  + blind, lame (stopped, unable to walk)

For I tell you, **none** of those men<br>
who were **invited** shall taste my banquet.

[Luke 14:24 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **redemption** is not only about
  + God's **grace** toward the undeserving
+ but also God's **judgment** on
  + those who **reject** his gift
+ in Matthew, the king declares:

The wedding feast is ready, <br>
but those **invited** were not **worthy**.

[Matthew 22:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **receiving** invitation (hearing God's word)

And he said to him, <br>
"Friend, how did you **get in** here <br>

And he was **speechless**.

Then the king said to the attendants,

"**Bind** him hand and foot and <br>

[Matthew 22:11-14 (ESV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ only those w/**wedding** clothes may enter
  + are the **poor** to buy new clothes?
+ no, it was the **host** who would 
  + **give** garments to guests
  + like wedding **favours** (cf Samson, Jdg14)

+ **clothes** in Scripture:
