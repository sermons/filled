## Luke: the Kingdom of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is **like**, and
  + Who will **enter** it
+ [Luke 14a](# "ref"): **feast** at home of prominent Pharisee 
  + [(v1-6)](# "ref") Man ill with *edema*:
    + **Healing** more important than rules
  + [(v7-11)](# "ref") *Guests* taking seats of honour:
    + **Humble** yourself, that God may exalt you
  + [(v12-14)](# "ref") *Host* of banquet:
    + Be **hospitable** to those who cannot repay you
+ Today: [v15-24](# "ref") Who is **worthy**
  + to enter the **feast** in the kingdom of God?

>>>
+ Edema: (beware hardening against Jesus)
+ Guests: even Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve
  + (beware exalting oneself)
+ Host: invite those who can't repay you
  + that you may be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous
+ Guest: how wonderful to feast in the kingdom of God!
  + impl.: how wonderful for **us**
  + assume will enter kingdom of God
+ today's parable is Jesus' reply:
  + don't be so sure you're going to be at that feast!

When one of those who reclined at table <br>
with him heard these things, he said to him,

“Blessed is everyone who will <br>
eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

******

[16](# "ref")
But he said to him, “A man once gave <br>
a great banquet and invited many.

[17](# "ref")
And at the time for the banquet <br>
he sent his servant to say <br>
to those who had been invited,

‘Come, for everything is now ready.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

******

[18](# "ref")
But they all alike began to make excuses.

The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, <br>
and I must go out and see it.<br>
Please have me excused.’

[19](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have bought <br>
five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. <br>
Please have me excused.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.3/6)](# "ref")

******

[20](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have married a wife,<br>
and therefore I cannot come.’

[21](# "ref")
So the servant came<br>
and reported these things to his master.

Then the master of the house became angry<br>
and said to his servant,

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

******

‘Go out quickly <br>
to the streets and lanes of the city,

and bring in the poor and crippled <br>
and blind and lame.’

[22](# "ref")
And the servant said,<br>
‘Sir, what you commanded has been done,<br>
and still there is room.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.5/6)](# "ref")

******

[23](# "ref")
And the master said to the servant,<br>
‘Go out to the highways and hedges

and compel people to come in,<br>
that my house may be filled.

[24](# "ref")
For I tell you, none of those men<br>
who were invited shall taste my banquet.’”

>>>
+ On first read, wonder **why** was master so **angry**?
  + guests' **excuses** seem reasonable
  + can't just **drop** everything for your party

+ to understand the **heart** of our
  + Heavenly Father of **abundant** blessings

follows outline of **salvation**: mini-gospel

2. fall/sin: priorities
3. extend invitation, fill the Father's House

[Matthew 22:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>

  + is like a wonderful **celebration**!
  + what beautiful **hope**
+ and God has already extended the **invitation** to us
______
+ for us, we rarely have big **celebrations**:
  + wedding, baby shower, etc.
+ e.g., our wedding banquet had **26 tables**
  + friend's had **40**
+ agonised over **guest list**
  + esp. **out-of-town** friends+relatives
  + regret not spending **time** w/them
+ but: ultimately, focus is **not** on guests
  + who "makes the **cut**" to be on the list
+ focus is on the **reason** for our joy
  + thankful to **God** for Providence
+ and we want to **share** that joy with others

and said to his servant,

‘Go out **quickly** <br>

and bring in the **poor** and **crippled** <br>
and **blind** and **lame**.’

[Luke 14:21 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ **angry**: Mt22:7 even more severe
+ **quickly**, at once: urgency
+ streets+alleys of city: both big and small streets, anywhere
+ poor, crippled (injured in limbs), blind, lame (stopped, unable to walk)

---
And the master said to the servant,<br>
‘Go out to the **highways** and **hedges**

[Luke 14:23 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **countryside**, farther afield: not enough guests
  + not necessarily **poor**
  + just **any** random person
+ **compel** them: might not be needy or as eager for a free meal
+ host's objective is to fill his house: celebrate, share his joy with those who would share his joy

For I tell you, **none** of those men<br>
who were **invited** shall taste my banquet.

[Matthew 22:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ again, guests' own accomplishments, prior relationship w/host, etc. are irrelevant
  + receiving invitation (hearing God's word) doesn't make us worthy
  + being poor doesn't make us worthy
  + being holy doesn't make us worthy
+ it takes action: coming to the feast
  + with intent: purpose is to share in Master's joy, not just get free meal

For many are **called**, but few are **chosen**.

>>>
+ clothes in Scripture: represent good deeds (e.g., Rev7:9)
  + only those with clean clothes (have done holiness) may enter
  + are the poor to buy clean, fancy wedding clothes?
+ no, it was the host who would give garments to guests, like wedding favours (cf Samson, Jdg14)
  + extravagance of clothes indicated wealth of host
+ so a guest w/o wedding clothes means he **refused** the gift!
+ only those w/holy living may enter heaven
  + God imputes holiness to us through Christ: gives us the clothes
  + but we must accept the gift
+ many are called (invited), few are chosen (selected by preference)
