## [Luke](# "ref"): the **Kingdom** of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and
  + Who will *enter* it
+ [(13:22-30)](# "ref") Parable of the **narrow gate**:
  + "Lord, *open* to us"
  + "I do not *know* where you come from.<br>*Depart* from me!"

>>>

  + the **kingdom** of God
+ Jesus sets the **record** straight on it, by
  + how He **heals** + performs miracles,
  + the **parables** He teaches, and

## [Luke 14](# "ref"): Teachings at a **Feast**
+ [(v1-6)](# "ref") Man ill with *edema*:
  + **Healing** more important than rules

>>>
+ At home of prominent **Pharisee**
+ **Edema**: (beware **hardening** against Jesus)
+ **Guests**: even Son of Man did not come to be **served** but to serve
  + (beware **exalting** oneself)
+ **Host**: invite those who **can't** repay you
  + that you may be repaid at the **resurrection** of the righteous
+ **Guest**: how wonderful to **feast** in the kingdom of God!

When one of those who reclined at table <br>
with him heard these things, he said to him,

“Blessed is everyone who will <br>
eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

******

[16](# "ref")
But he said to him, “A man once gave <br>
a great banquet and invited many.

[17](# "ref")
And at the time for the banquet <br>
he sent his servant to say <br>
to those who had been invited,

‘Come, for everything is now ready.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

******

[18](# "ref")
But they all alike began to make excuses.

The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, <br>
and I must go out and see it.<br>
Please have me excused.’

[19](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have bought <br>
five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. <br>
Please have me excused.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.3/6)](# "ref")

******

[20](# "ref")
And another said, ‘I have married a wife,<br>
and therefore I cannot come.’

[21](# "ref")
So the servant came<br>
and reported these things to his master.

Then the master of the house became angry<br>
and said to his servant,

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

******

‘Go out quickly <br>
to the streets and lanes of the city,

and bring in the poor and crippled <br>
and blind and lame.’

[22](# "ref")
And the servant said,<br>
‘Sir, what you commanded has been done,<br>
and still there is room.’

[Luke 14:15-24 (ESV) (p.5/6)](# "ref")

******

[23](# "ref")
And the master said to the servant,<br>
‘Go out to the highways and hedges

and compel people to come in,<br>
that my house may be filled.

[24](# "ref")
For I tell you, none of those men<br>
who were invited shall taste my banquet.’”

## Parable of the Banquet [(Lk14)](# "ref")
1. Rejoicing [(v16-17)](# "ref")
1. Rejection [(v18-20)](# "ref")
1. Redemption [(v21-24)](# "ref")

>>>
+ On first read, wonder **why** was master so **angry**?
  + guests' **excuses** seem reasonable
  + can't just **drop** everything for your party
+ But dive **deeper** into this passage and
  + parallel parable in Mt22:1-14
+ to understand the **heart** of our
  + Heavenly Father of **abundant** blessings
+ 3 **parts** of this parable
  + follows outline of **salvation**: mini-gospel

1. master's **invitation** to share in celebration
  + focus is not on **guest list**
  + but on master's **joy** which he wishes to share
2. guests' **response** 
  + fall/sin
  + priorities
3. master **extends** invitation to all comers
  + **fill** His house
  + all who would **accept** His gift
  + and **share** in His joy

+ First: dwell on heart of Father
  + not on our own sorrows/needs

---
A man once gave <br>
a great **banquet** and invited **many**.

[Luke 14:16 (ESV)](# "ref")

The kingdom of heaven may be compared to <br>
a **king** who gave a **wedding feast** for his son

[Matthew 22:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ plenty of **room**: huge celebration
  + king would've been very **wealthy**
+ isn't it **nice** that the **kingdom of heaven**
  + is like a wonderful **celebration**!
  + what beautiful **hope**
______
+ for us, we rarely have big **celebrations**:
  + wedding, baby shower, etc.
+ e.g., our wedding banquet had **26 tables**
  + friend's had **40**
+ agonised over **guest list**
  + esp. **out-of-town** friends+relatives
  + regret not spending **time** w/them
+ but: ultimately, focus is **not** on guests
  + who "makes the **cut**" to be on the list
+ focus is on the **reason** for our joy
  + thankful to **God** for Providence
+ and we want to **share** that joy with others

---
And at the **time** for the banquet <br>
he sent his servant to say <br>
to those who had been **invited**,<br>
"Come, for everything is now **ready**."

[Luke 14:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

"My **oxen** and my fat calves <br>
have been **slaughtered**"

[Matthew 22:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ a celebration that **big** would have been
  + **planned** well in advance: **save-the-date**
  + implied that guests already RSVPd
+ so when **time** came,
  + (Mt) oxen killed: can't **cancel**
+ king is **looking forward** to
  + **sharing** his joy w/guests
+ So the **King of kings** has a **celebration** planned
  + when we **see** Him face to face:

---
And I saw the **holy city**, new Jerusalem,<br>
coming down out of **heaven** from God,<br>
prepared as a **bride** adorned for her husband.

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

---
[3](# "ref")
And I heard <br>
a loud voice from the throne saying,

“Behold! <br>
the **dwelling place** of God is with man.

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

---
He will dwell with them, <br>
and they will be **his people**,

and God himself will be with them <br>
as **their God**.

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

---
[4](# "ref")
He will wipe away every **tear** from their eyes,

and **death** shall be no more,<br>
neither shall there be **mourning**,<br>
nor **crying**, nor **pain** anymore,

for the **former** things have passed away.”

[Revelation 21:2-4 (ESV) (p.3/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ our ultimate **hope** is
+ not that we will **eradicate** disease
  + just get back to our **normal** lives
+ bc **death**, pain, and sin belong to 
  + this **present** age
+ but we have a future **hope**
  + the **wedding** feast
  + culmination of God's plan of **salvation**

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# What **joy** does <br> the King wish <br> to **share** with us?

>>>
+ this is the **focus**:
  + not who's on the **guest list**
  + but the **reason** for the celebration
+ **parable** in Mt: prince's **wedding**
+ what is the **reason** for 
  + the Master's **joy**?
+ (prompt for pause)

---
## outline 2

>>>
+ **response** from the guests
+ the **invited**: Jews, the churched
  + those who have heard Christ's **call**
  + and even said "yes" to God! (**RSVP**)
+ **excuses** indicate they've 
  + continued w/regular **routine**

---
"I have bought a **field**, <br>
and I must go out and see it.<br>
Please have me **excused**."

[19](# "ref")
"I have bought five yoke of **oxen**, <br>
and I go to examine them."

[20](# "ref")
"I have **married** a wife, <br>
and therefore I **cannot** come."

[Luke 14:18-20 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ field: buying property, having **possessions**
+ oxen: invest in business, building **career**
+ married: **relationships** / family
+ all good **blessings** from God
  + things that normally **fill** our lives
+ COVID19: all these on **hold**
  + **life** more important
+ but do we only want to go back to **normal**
  + return to daily life? 
+ Mt describes an even **stronger** response:

---
They paid **no attention** and went off, <br>
one to his **farm**, <br>
another to his **business**, 

[6](# "ref")
while the rest **seized** his servants, <br>
treated them **shamefully**, <br>
and **killed** them.

[Matthew 22:5-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ beat, humiliated, **killed** servants
+ why must you keep **reminding** me?

---
I was ready to be **sought**<br>
by those who **did not ask** for me;

I was ready to be **found**<br>
by those who **did not seek** me.

[Isaiah 65:1-2 (ESV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

---
I said, “**Here I am**, here I am,”<br>
to a nation that was not called by my **name**.

[2](# "ref")
I **spread out** my hands all the day<br>
to a **rebellious** people

[Isaiah 65:1-2 (ESV) (p.2/2)](# "ref")

---
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, <br>
the city that **kills** the prophets <br>
and **stones** those who are sent to it!

How often would I have<br>
gathered your **children** together<br>
as a **hen** gathers her brood under her wings,

and you were **not willing**!

[Luke 13:34 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
For thus said the Lord God,<br>
the Holy One of Israel,

“In **returning** and **rest** you shall be saved;<br>
in **quietness** and in **trust**<br>
shall be your strength.”

But you were **unwilling**!

[Isaiah 30:15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "cancel culture": flexibility, spontaneity, but also lack of commitment, demonstrates where our priorities are
+ what we've built for ourselves becomes important to us
  + God's continual invitation/reminder interrupts our daily life, becomes annoying
+ so proud of being invited
  + but do we actually want to go? 

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Am I <br> looking **forward** to <br> Christ's **return**? **Why**?

>>>
+ complete **upheaval** of way of life
+ prior to return, increased
  + natural disasters: famine, disease
  + human disasters: war, betrayal
+ our **hope** is not that God 
  + restores our **"normal"** daily habits
  + but a **joy** far beyond anything in this life
+ (pause for discussion)

---
## outline 3

>>>
1. Master has a **reason** to celebrate
  + wants to **share** His joy
2. Guests just want to get on w/**regular life**
  + **annoyed** at master's reminders
3. Master's **reaction**:
  + **extend** invitation to all 
    + who would share His joy
  + judgment + **shame** for those who 
    + **rejected** the invitation

---
Then the master of the house became **angry**<br>
and said to his servant,

‘Go out **quickly** <br>
to the **streets** and **lanes** of the city,

and bring in the **poor** and **crippled** <br>
and **blind** and **lame**.’

[Luke 14:21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **angry**: Mt22:7 even more severe
+ **quickly**, at once: urgency
+ streets+alleys of city: both big and small streets, anywhere
+ poor, crippled (injured in limbs), blind, lame (stopped, unable to walk)

---
And the master said to the servant,<br>
‘Go out to the **highways** and **hedges**

and **compel** people to come in,<br>
that my house may be **filled**.

[Luke 14:23 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **countryside**, farther afield: not enough guests
  + not necessarily **poor**
  + just **any** random person
+ **compel** them: might not be needy or as eager for a free meal
+ host's objective is to fill his house: celebrate, share his joy with those who would share his joy

---
For I tell you, **none** of those men<br>
who were **invited** shall taste my banquet.

[Luke 14:24 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ redemption is not only about
  + God's **grace** toward the undeserving
+ but also God's **judgment** on
  + those who **reject** his gift

---
The wedding feast is ready, <br>
but those **invited** were not **worthy**.

[Matthew 22:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ again, guests' own accomplishments, prior relationship w/host, etc. are irrelevant
  + receiving invitation (hearing God's word) doesn't make us worthy
  + being poor doesn't make us worthy
  + being holy doesn't make us worthy
+ it takes action: coming to the feast
  + with intent: purpose is to share in Master's joy, not just get free meal

---
But when the king came in <br>
to look at the **guests**, he saw there <br>
a man who had no **wedding garment**. 

[12](# "ref")
And he said to him, <br>
"Friend, how did you **get in** here <br>
without a **wedding garment**?"<br>
And he was **speechless**. 

[Matthew 22:11-14 (ESV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

---
[13](# "ref")
Then the king said to the attendants,

"**Bind** him hand and foot and <br>
**cast** him into the outer darkness.

In that place there will be<br>
**weeping** and gnashing of teeth."

[Matthew 22:11-14 (ESV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ only those w/**wedding** clothes may enter
  + are the **poor** to buy new clothes?
+ no, it was the **host** who would 
  + **give** garments to guests
  + like wedding **favours** (cf Samson, Jdg14)
  + **extravagance** of clothes indicated wealth of host
+ so a guest **w/o** wedding clothes means
  + he **refused** the gift!
+ indicates his **intent** was just a free **meal**
  + didn't **care** about the celebration
+ **clothes** in Scripture: 
  + often represent good **deeds** (e.g., Rev7:9)
+ only those w/holy **lives** may enter heaven
  + we **poor** cannot **become** holy on own
+ God **imputes** holiness to us through Christ
  + **gives** us the clothes
  + but we must **accept** the gift

[14](# "ref")
For many are **called**, <br>
but few are **chosen**.

[Matthew 22:11-14 (ESV) (p.3/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God's **invitation** is to all
  + first to the **churched** <br>
    (Jews, invited guests)
  + then to the ends of the **earth** <br>
    (Gentiles, random public)
+ but few are **chosen** ("called-out")
  + selected by **preference**
+ not simply **adding** God's blessings
  + on top of our daily **routine**
+ but **cherish** God's presence
  + as the greatest **treasure**
+ this **faith** is also God's **gift**
  + given to those He has **chosen**
